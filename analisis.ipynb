at 7pm, at West of Lenin&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Directed by Rebecca Tourino Collinsworth and featuring Rebecca and Brandon&lt;br /&gt; Tourino Collinsworth, Fawn Ledesma, Joe Ivey, and Andrew Lee Creech, TRUMP&amp;#8217;D is the 5th in a series of workshop productions of new plays by local playwrights produced by Parley in 2016. Admission is pay what you will.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In TRUMP&amp;#8217;D, we meet Alma, who crossed the border separating Mexico and the United States at age 17 to give birth to her daughter, Angel. Now, 16 years later, Donald Trump is making his ascent toward the presidency, police brutality runs rampant, and a stranger with a penchant for milk visits the cantina where Alma works. When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy. In 2016, who benefits from the abundance in the land of plenty?&lt;br /&gt; Benjamin Benne is a Playwrights&amp;#39; Center 2016-17 Many Voices Fellow. He was a participant in New York Theatre Intensives 2011 summer conservatory (in association with Ensemble Studio Theatre) and the 2013 NoPassport Playwriting Intensive with OBIE Award-winning playwright Caridad Svich. His play at the very bottom of a body of water (2016 O&amp;#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist; 2016 Bay Area Playwrights Festival finalist) is currently receiving development support by Umbrella Project, a Seattle-based new play advocacy group. Terra Incognita (2014 O&amp;#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist) will have its world premiere this summer at Annex Theatre.

</td><td>Center on Contemporary Art Releases New Pop-Up (AR)t Book&lt;br /&gt; Art Book Goes High Tech, Uses Augmented Reality (AR) to Bring Virtual Art to the Real World&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As part of CoCA&amp;#8217;s ongoing effort to push the boundaries of contemporary art&amp;#8212;in this case by bringing new technology to its publications&amp;#8212;CoCA jurors Joseph Roberts and David Francis have worked with Curator and Producer Ray C. Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&amp;#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &amp;#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.&lt;br /&gt; CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception&lt;br /&gt; CoCA will celebrate the launch of &amp;#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&amp;#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &amp;#8220;targets&amp;#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;virtual&amp;#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&amp;#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.&lt;br /&gt; In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.&lt;br /&gt; Rock&amp;#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.&lt;br /&gt; How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt; The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (&lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\"&gt;itunes.apple.com&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;) and on Google Play (&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\"&gt;play.google.com&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;).

But what about the man behind the standup? In A Carlin Home Companion, Carlin&amp;#39;s daughter Kelly Carlin shares her story of growing up with the legendary comedian&amp;#8212;from her front row seat to Carlin&amp;#39;s comedic invention to her frequent role as the only \"adult\" in a family known for their alcoholism, cocaine addition, drug arrests, psychotic breaks, and crippling IRS debt. Vivid, hilarious, and heartbreaking, the book contemplates the role of her father in her life and what it takes to move beyond our childhoods and forge a life of our own.

All cooking supplies and ingredients will be provided, but please bring your own apron. The class focuses on the traditional preparation of authentic traditional latin dishes. The dishes are prepared in the handmade and traditional fashion using cultural ingredients.

All cooking supplies and ingredients will be provided, but please bring your own apron. The class focuses on the traditional preparation of authentic traditional latin dishes. The dishes are prepared in the handmade and traditional fashion using cultural ingredients.

All cooking supplies and ingredients will be provided, but please bring your own apron. The class focuses on the traditional preparation of authentic traditional latin dishes. The dishes are prepared in the handmade and traditional fashion using cultural ingredients.

All cooking supplies and ingredients will be provided, but please bring your own apron. The class focuses on the traditional preparation of authentic traditional latin dishes. The dishes are prepared in the handmade and traditional fashion using cultural ingredients.

All cooking supplies and ingredients will be provided, but please bring your own apron. The class focuses on the traditional preparation of authentic traditional latin dishes. The dishes are prepared in the handmade and traditional fashion using cultural ingredients.

production of TRUMP\\&\\#8217;D by Benjamin Benne<br /> <br /> May 17th at 7pm, at West of Lenin<br /> <br /> Directed by Rebecca Tourino Collinsworth and featuring Rebecca and Brandon<br /> Tourino Collinsworth, Fawn Ledesma, Joe Ivey, and Andrew Lee Creech, TRUMP\\&\\#8217;D is the 5th in a series of workshop productions of new plays by local playwrights produced by Parley in 2016. Admission is pay what you will.<br /> <br /> In TRUMP\\&\\#8217;D, we meet Alma, who crossed the border separating Mexico and the United States at age 17 to give birth to her daughter, Angel. Now, 16 years later, Donald Trump is making his ascent toward the presidency, police brutality runs rampant, and a stranger with a penchant for milk visits the cantina where Alma works. When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy. In 2016, who benefits from the abundance in the land of plenty?<br /> Benjamin Benne is a Playwrights\\&\\#39; Center 2016-17 Many Voices Fellow. He was a participant in New York Theatre Intensives 2011 summer conservatory (in association with Ensemble Studio Theatre) and the 2013 NoPassport Playwriting Intensive with OBIE Award-winning playwright Caridad Svich. His play at the very bottom of a body of water (2016 O\\&\\#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist; 2016 Bay Area Playwrights Festival finalist) is currently receiving development support by Umbrella Project, a Seattle-based new play advocacy group. Terra Incognita (2014 O\\&\\#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist) will have its world premiere this summer at Annex Theatre.

Virtual Art to the Real World<br /> <br /> As part of CoCA\\&\\#8217;s ongoing effort to push the boundaries of contemporary art\\&\\#8212;in this case by bringing new technology to its publications\\&\\#8212;CoCA jurors Joseph Roberts and David Francis have worked with Curator and Producer Ray C. Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists\\&\\#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device \\&\\#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of \\&\\#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,\\&\\#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR \\&\\#8220;targets\\&\\#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the \\&\\#8220;real\\&\\#8221; and the \\&\\#8220;virtual\\&\\#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year\\&\\#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock\\&\\#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,\\&\\#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"\\_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com\\&\\#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"\\_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com\\&\\#8230;</a>).

legend always eager to buck the establishment. But what about the man behind the standup? In A Carlin Home Companion, Carlin\\&\\#39;s daughter Kelly Carlin shares her story of growing up with the legendary comedian\\&\\#8212;from her front row seat to Carlin\\&\\#39;s comedic invention to her frequent role as the only \"adult\" in a family known for their alcoholism, cocaine addition, drug arrests, psychotic breaks, and crippling IRS debt. Vivid, hilarious, and heartbreaking, the book contemplates the role of her father in her life and what it takes to move beyond our childhoods and forge a life of our own. Cariln will join us for a discussion and signing of the eye-opening, insightful, and humorous read.

Where\\&\\#39;s the remote? Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death. In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, \\&\\#8220;Richard Strand {[}the playwright{]} captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings.

                                                  | Parley announces a workshop production of TRUMP&#8217;D by Benjamin Benne<br /> <br /> May 17th at 7pm, at West of Lenin<br /> <br /> Directed by Rebecca Tourino Collinsworth and featuring Rebecca and Brandon<br /> Tourino Collinsworth, Fawn Ledesma, Joe Ivey, and Andrew Lee Creech, TRUMP&#8217;D is the 5th in a series of workshop productions of new plays by local playwrights produced by Parley in 2016. Admission is pay what you will.<br /> <br /> In TRUMP&#8217;D, we meet Alma, who crossed the border separating Mexico and the United States at age 17 to give birth to her daughter, Angel. Now, 16 years later, Donald Trump is making his ascent toward the presidency, police brutality runs rampant, and a stranger with a penchant for milk visits the cantina where Alma works. When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy. In 2016, who benefits from the abundance in the land of plenty?<br /> Benjamin Benne is a Playwrights&#39; Center 2016-17 Many Voices Fellow.

Real World<br /> <br /> As part of CoCA&#8217;s ongoing effort to push the boundaries of contemporary art&#8212;in this case by bringing new technology to its publications&#8212;CoCA jurors Joseph Roberts and David Francis have worked with Curator and Producer Ray C. Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

eager to buck the establishment. But what about the man behind the standup? In A Carlin Home Companion, Carlin&#39;s daughter Kelly Carlin shares her story of growing up with the legendary comedian&#8212;from her front row seat to Carlin&#39;s comedic invention to her frequent role as the only \"adult\" in a family known for their alcoholism, cocaine addition, drug arrests, psychotic breaks, and crippling IRS debt. Vivid, hilarious, and heartbreaking, the book contemplates the role of her father in her life and what it takes to move beyond our childhoods and forge a life of our own. Cariln will join us for a discussion and signing of the eye-opening, insightful, and humorous read.

Where&#39;s the remote? Retired college professor Emily Linder summons her daughters to share her recent realization: she knows the precise time of her death. In this quirky comedic drama one eccentric family will amuse and surprise you with their preoccupations, recognitions and realizations.<br /> <br /> Director Nathan Kessler-Jeffrey said, &#8220;Richard Strand [the playwright] captures a family dealing with the new challenges of an aging parent and the old rivalries of competitive siblings. This story&#8217;s honesty and hilarity will not only touch mothers and daughters and caregivers of aging parents, but everyone who has dealt with the difficulty of growing up and watching the world change drastically around them.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Kessler-Jeffrey previously directed the extended run of Jeeves Intervenes from TTC&#39;s 2015 Season. He also directs Taproot&#39;s bullying prevention Road Company shows that tour throughout the state of Washington.<br /> <br /> The cast includes Laura Kenny (10 Things I Hate About You, Village Theatre&#39;s Mary Poppins) as the titular character Emily Linder with Helen Harvester (Taproot Theatre&#39;s Diana of Dobson&#39;s) as Janet, Charity Parenzini (Taproot Theatre&#39;s This Christmas)

       "17   Parley announces a workshop production of TRUMP&#8217;D by Benjamin Benne<br /> <br /> May 17th at 7pm, at West of Lenin<br /> <br /> Directed by Rebecca Tourino Collinsworth and featuring Rebecca and Brandon<br /> Tourino Collinsworth, Fawn Ledesma, Joe Ivey, and Andrew Lee Creech, TRUMP&#8217;D is the 5th in a series of workshop productions of new plays by local playwrights produced by Parley in 2016. Admission is pay what you will.<br /> <br /> In TRUMP&#8217;D, we meet Alma, who crossed the border separating Mexico and the United States at age 17 to give birth to her daughter, Angel. Now, 16 years later, Donald Trump is making his ascent toward the presidency, police brutality runs rampant, and a stranger with a penchant for milk visits the cantina where Alma works. When the line between having everything to gain and nothing to lose dissipates, Alma is left to question whether the American Dream has merely been a fantasy. In 2016, who benefits from the abundance in the land of plenty?<br /> Benjamin Benne is a Playwrights&#39; Center 2016-17 Many Voices Fellow. He was a participant in New York Theatre Intensives 2011 summer conservatory (in association with Ensemble Studio Theatre) and the 2013 NoPassport Playwriting Intensive with OBIE Award-winning playwright Caridad Svich. His play at the very bottom of a body of water (2016 O&#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist; 2016 Bay Area Playwrights Festival finalist) is currently receiving development support by Umbrella Project, a Seattle-based new play advocacy group. Terra Incognita (2014 O&#39;Neill Playwrights Conference semi-finalist) will have its world premiere this summer at Annex Theatre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "24   Center on Contemporary Art Releases New Pop-Up (AR)t Book<br /> Art Book Goes High Tech, Uses Augmented Reality (AR) to Bring Virtual Art to the Real World<br /> <br /> As part of CoCA&#8217;s ongoing effort to push the boundaries of contemporary art&#8212;in this case by bringing new technology to its publications&#8212;CoCA jurors Joseph Roberts and David Francis have worked with Curator and Producer Ray C. Freeman III to select 18 contemporary artworks to present in a technology-enhanced art volume, Pop-up (AR)t Book. Similar to a traditional pop-up book, three dimensional versions of featured artists&#8217; work will spring to life as the viewer turns each page. But instead of elaborate paper cutouts, new technology called Augmented Reality (AR) will allow the viewer to see the artwork in three dimensions on their mobile device &#8211; iPhone, iPad, and Android.<br /> CoCA to Celebrate Launch Of Pop-Up (AR)t at Special Reception<br /> CoCA will celebrate the launch of &#8220;CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221; with a Book Release Party and Exhibition at the opening reception on May 12 from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at CoCA Rubix, 515 Harvard Avenue East, Seattle.<br /> <br /> In addition to the book, the artists will be featured with backlit AR &#8220;targets&#8221; that allow visitors to view larger scale AR representations of the art in the context of a gallery show. Physical versions of the artwork will also be on view so gallery goers can experience both the &#8220;real&#8221; and the &#8220;virtual&#8221; editions of selected works. The event will also host a full-scale re-creation of the CoCA p(AR)k exhibition presented at last year&#8217;s PARKing Day event. Pieces from that event include 10-foot-tall AR trees created by Casey Scalf of sensebellum.com.<br /> In addition to Scalf, other participants in the project include Northwest artists Miguel Edwards, Alan Fulle, Jeff Mihalyo, Ray C. Freeman III, Stephen Rock, BK Tran, j shagam, Xavier Lopez, Jr., Karen Hackenberg, L. Kelly Lyles, and Reilly Donovan together with California artists Amiko Matsuo, Megan Geckler, Corey Dunlap, and Bradley Tsalyuk, plus Joseph Reyes from Seoul, Korea.<br /> Rock&#8217;s Studio provided the printing for the exhibition, and Castanes Architects, P.S., A.I.A. contributed software used to assemble many of the models in the book and exhibition.<br /> How to View CoCA Pop-Up (AR)t,&#8221;<br /> The Wikitude app used to view the 3D models in the book and exhibition can be found in the iOS App Store (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikitude/id329731243?mt=8\">itunes.apple.com&#8230;</a>) and on Google Play (<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude\">play.google.com&#8230;</a>).

       "25   Most of us remember George Carlin as a provocative comedy legend always eager to buck the establishment. But what about the man behind the standup? In A Carlin Home Companion, Carlin&#39;s daughter Kelly Carlin shares her story of growing up with the legendary comedian&#8212;from her front row seat to Carlin&#39;s comedic invention to her frequent role as the only \"adult\" in a family known for their alcoholism, cocaine addition, drug arrests, psychotic breaks, and crippling IRS debt. Vivid, hilarious, and heartbreaking, the book contemplates the role of her father in her life and what it takes to move beyond our childhoods and forge a life of our own. Cariln will join us for a discussion and signing of the eye-opening, insightful, and humorous read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
